EVOLUTION OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
MACHINE LANGUAGE → ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE → C → C++ → JAVA → OTHER HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE 

Java is OBJECT ORIENTED and platform INDEPENDENT programming language used for a wide range of applications and also with capabilitiy of write once run anywhere .

JAVA BACKGROUND :
JAVA was developed by JAMES GHOSLING at SUN MICROSYSTEMS . Initially named as OAK , Java along with sun microsystems was acquired by oracle , The oracle was created a special run time environment to run java 
program which is known as JRE . It includes some libraries and classes along with JRE a development tool kit was made to create java based softwares which is known as JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT [JDK].

KEY FEATURES:-
1.Object oriented 
2.platform independent 
3.high level language 
4.memory safe 
5.secure 
6.multithreaded 
7.rich libraries and API's [ Application programming interface ] 

COMMON USES OF JAVA  :-
1.Andriod mobile development 
2.Web development 
3.Enterprise application 
4.Desktop application 
5.Big data 
6.Internet of Things [IoT]

WORKING OF JAVA PROGRAM :-

SOURCE CODE → COMPILER BYTE CODE → JVM [ INTERPRETER ] → MACHINE CODE .
The source code of java is saved with a file name having an extension of [ .java ] 
JAVA IS CASE SENSITIVE LANGUAGE .

JAVA BASIC SYNTAX :-

SYNTAX:- A set of rules strictly followed for a particular programming language .
SEMANTICS :- The underlying functions performed by a syntax are defined with the help of semantics .

EXAMPLE :-

public class Helloworld{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        System.out.print("Hello world \n");
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}

OUTPUT :-
Hello world 
Hello world

JAVA LIBRARIES :-
CORE JAVA LIBRARIES & FRAMEWORKS:-
1.JAVA STANDARD LIBRARY → Foundation of java development providing core classes for I/O ,networking,collections and more .
2.APACHE COMMONS → A collection of reusable java components for various tasks,including string manipulation mathematical operations , file handling .
3.Guava → Googles library offering utilities for collections , caching ( temporary storage ) , concurrency [ multitasking] , and more enhancing development efficieny .
4.Junit → A widely used framework for unit testing , enabling developers to write and run tests to verify the correctness of their code.

SPECIALIZED LIBRARIES :-
1.Jackson    4.Mockito            7.Lombok
2.GSon       5.JAXB               8.Apache POI 
3.Log4j      6.Http CLient        9.iText
